## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
,
                                           br(),
                                           plotOutput("plot4"),
                                           p("There is a measure of the estimated mean female-male gap in the Stanford Education dataset. Grouping
                                             by county, this plot shows the counties with the largest female-male gaps across the country."),
                                           br(),
                                           p("All of these plots show interesting variations in academic performance by gender that should be further investigated
                                             in future research. What are the root causes of these gender differences? Could it be due to teacher bias, curriculum,
                                             culture, etc.? These would be very interesting questions to explore via a more in-depth study.")
